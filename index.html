    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>
      This course is an introduction to front end web design and development
      using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and
      various software programs. The course consists of lectures and
      demonstrations on the design principles necessary to create an effective
      website as well as how to use code and other tools to bring it to life.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the semester we will be working towards developing unique,
      custom websites based on what we have been learning during lectures and
      demonstrations. There will be feedback sessions where students will
      present the rationale behind their work as well as working sessions to
      further hone the skills learned during demonstrations. This course moves
      quickly, and new concepts each week build on previous material. Attendance
      and participation is extremely important.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Purpose and Learning Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Students will learn technical skills and conceptual practices required for
      modern web development and how to collaborate with web developers as a
      designer. This foundational course will provide a basic understanding of
      internet history, how web development works, and the principles of good
      user experience and visual design on the web. By the end of the course,
      students should be able to build a fully functioning front-end web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the rapid pace at which web standards and technologies evolve, the
      goal of this course is to give students a practical working knowledge of
      the latest and current design practices, as well as an understanding of
      the broader concepts involved. This will provide the tools and base
      knowledge required to remain up to date on the latest standards and
      practices going forward.
    </p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>Grades with be determined according to the following formula:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>25% Final Website</li>
      <li>

        mockups)
      </li>
      <li>50% Weekly Assignments (including In-Class)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <p>
      <i
        >Students are expected to participate in this course through regular
        attendance at lecture and lab sessions, complete assignments as
